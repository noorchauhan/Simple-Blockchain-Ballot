# Simple-Blockchain-Ballot

This a demonstration of a simple Ballot box system on the Blockchain.\
The following code is written in Solidity programming language.\

To test the smart contract out, head over to https://remix.ethereum.org :
* Copy-Paste the Election.sol file in remix solidity environment
* Deploy the contract on test network of your choice
* Create an Election instace using the contract functions
* Now with your contract-owner account you can authorize voters to vote
